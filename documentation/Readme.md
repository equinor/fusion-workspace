(CC workspace v2.0)

## Pre work and speck

- New Workspace Speck
- Workspace Diagrams
- Workshop

Apps conversion and scale strategy.

This is a speck document for the `Fusion Project Portal 1.0.0v` based on proof-of-concept `Johan Castberg Portal`. This is just an assumption of a hi level scope for the project to come, only to verify the initial thoughts. The work required to scale can be split into three parts. Work related to the workspace and the components it relies on, the Project Portal, and the conversion of `Castberg` apps to be fusion powered and ready for scale.  

- Workspace
- Fusion Workspace  
- Fusion Project Portal  
- Apps conversion / scale

These document will focus on the workspace section of the pre-work.
