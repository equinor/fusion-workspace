## Suspense and error boundaries

Boundaries are heavily used throughout the workspace package.
Some components passed as part of the workspace configuration will be wrapped in suspense and error boundary.
Components like sidesheet and custom garden components.

`Throwing promises is an experimental features, the only stable usage of suspense boundaries are for lazy loading components using the inbuilt react lazy function.`

```tsx
//Will trigger suspense boundary while loading
const Component = lazy(() => import('./lazyComponent'));

/**
 * @example
 */
function App() {
	return (
		<Suspense fallback={Loading...}>
			<Component />
		</Suspense>
	);
}
```

### Suspense

If a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/promise) is thrown the suspense boundary will render a fallback component while the promise is in the state `pending`.
For most of the cases our fallback component will be the `CircularProgress` from [EDS](https://eds.equinor.com).

### Error boundary

React supports error boundaries but do not provide any native component for using it.
For our implementation we chose the package [react-error-boundary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-boundary).
Just as with suspense an error boundary is triggered using a thrown promise in a component. The difference is the error boundary triggers when the promise changes its state to `rejected`.

### Taking control

If the default suspense and error boundaries do not satisfy your needs, wrap your components in your own suspense and error boundary.

```tsx
/**
 * @example - Example using lazy loading of components
 */

const Component = lazy(() => import("./Component"))

//Pass this one to the workspace config
//I.E garden config CustomItemView
function YourWrapper() {
	return (
		<ErrorBoundary>
			<Suspense fallback={Loading....}>
				<Component />
			</Suspense>
		</ErrorBoundary>
	);
}
```
