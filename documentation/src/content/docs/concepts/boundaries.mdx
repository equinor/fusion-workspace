## Suspsense and error boundaries

Boundaries are heavily used throughout the workspace package.
Every custom component passed from the config will be wrapped with a suspense and error boundary.

### Suspense

If a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/promise) is thrown the suspense boundary will render a fallback component while the promise is in the state `pending`.
For most of the cases our fallback component will be the `CircularProgess` from [EDS](https://eds.equinor.com).

### Error boundary

React supports error boundaries but do not provide any native component for using it.
For our implementation we chose the package [react-error-boundary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-boundary).
Just as with suspense an error boundary is triggered using a thrown promise in a component. The difference is the error boundary triggers when the promise changes its state to `rejected`.

### Taking control

If the default suspense and error boundaries does not satisfy your needs, wrap your components in your own suspense and error boundary.
