## Coming soon....

### Getting started

Workspace uses [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/), most of the configuration is a clone of the ag-grid declaration.
Suggested read: [AG Grid docs](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/)

The most important to get started with is [column definitions](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/column-definitions/).
